For this post, I wanted to talk about React Hooks, since I have been diving into learning what I can about them. Below are listed some built in Hooks.

**useState:** is used to add state to components. Things like simple values can be created and tracked.

**useEffect** is used to fetch API data on mounts, listen for events, and cleanup after itself on unmount.

**useContent** is used to share state globally. Theme switching, authentication, and language settings are good examples.
